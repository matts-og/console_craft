# Installation

Install Minecraft

Install SpigotMC server

Install ScriptCraft plugin to Spigot

Git clone auto-test (to use the python session class).
Copy api_request.py to the auto-test directory (or symlink it)

Copy console-craft.js to scriptcrtaft/plugins directory (note you have to run the minecraft server at least once to have this plugins dir created)

# Usage

Point crosshairs a block and type '/jsp get-consoles'. This should produce a staircase with the console server names.

Point crosshairs at the block under the sign that has the console name on it and type '/jsp load-console'. This should cause a platform to extend out to the right with the serial ports status.
